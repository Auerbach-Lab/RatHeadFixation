## Description
This is a novel head fixation system for adult laboratory rats, suitable for audiology research, intended to allow free access to the inferior colliculus, prefrontal cortex, and auditory cortex.


## Parts
**Assembly - v4** -- The headplate and fixation aseembly. Headplates can be 3d printed in stainless steel (such as 316) from a variety of manufacturers; [Craftcloud](craftcloud3d.com) allows easy comparison shopping. 

**Drilling template** -- Cut-down headplate with substantially reduced thickness to facilitate marking locations of screw holes onto the skull. Print in same material (i.e. steel) at same scaling compensation as the main headplate to ensure identical spacing.

**Button-head torx screws, #0-80 thread, 1/8" long** -- Two bone screws are optionally used per headplate, e.g. [McMaster #90910A665](https://www.mcmaster.com/90910A665/). The headplates are to be tapped with #0-80 threads on the provided holes to mate with the screws. The 1/8" length is sized so that the screw tip should penetrate the skull but not the dura when fully driven.

**IP5 Torx-plus bit and driver** -- Socket head screws are driven using a torx+ bit, e.g. [McMaster #54305A18](https://www.mcmaster.com/54305A18/). A mini ratcheting 1/4" shank driver e.g. [McMaster #52815A22](https://www.mcmaster.com/52815A22/) is appropriate for such these bits.

**1.35mm Spiral or burr drill bit** -- #0 (1.59mm) screws are intended for use with a 1.35mm diameter hole. For a 3.175mm shank, consider e.g. [McMaster #6415NM179](https://www.mcmaster.com/6415N179/), but first verify compatiblity with the dental drill in use. 

**1/4"-20 Standoffs, various lengths** -- A variety lengths of [standoffs](https://www.mcmaster.com/products/male-female-threaded-hex-standoffs/male-female-threaded-hex-standoffs-6/thread-size~1-4-20/material~stainless-steel-2/material~18-8-stainless-steel/), all of which can mate with the ThorLabs table and each other. These provide the clamping surface used with either end of the headplate. Extra standoffs allow use in combination to assemble a clamping surface at any desired height above the bed of the table.

**Threaded inserts, #6-32 to 1/4"-20** -- 
Use threaded inserts, e.g. [McMaster #90247A008](https://www.mcmaster.com/90247A008) in the shortest pair of standoffs and with the pair of the most commonly used length. The inserts allow mating with the cam clamps that top the standoffs in use. Installation of threaded inserts is permanent. 

**Clamping handle with threaded stud, #6-32 thread, 3/8" long**  -- These clamps, e.g. [McMaster #5720K25](https://www.mcmaster.com/5720K25/) are fastened to the top standoffs in use, with the aid of the threaded inserts. They should be threaded into the standoff so that the plate can be quickly inserted onto the exposed threaded stud, so that the plate is sandwiched between the circular plastic piece above and the standoff's surface below. Operating a clamp can be done one-handed in approximately a single second. When engaged, clamps exert up to 1400 N of clamping force.
