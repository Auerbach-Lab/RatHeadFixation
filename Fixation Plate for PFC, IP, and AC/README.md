## Description
This is a novel head fixation system for adult laboratory rats, suitable for audiology research, intended to allow free access to the inferior colliculus, prefrontal cortex, and auditory cortex.


## Parts
**Assembly - v4** -- The headplate and fixation aseembly. Headplates can be 3d printed in stainless steel (such as 316) from a variety of manufacturers; [Craftcloud](craftcloud3d.com) allows easy comparison shopping. The leading edge of the headplate sits roughly along the coronal suture when properly positioned on the skull.

**Drilling template** -- Cut-down headplate with substantially reduced thickness to facilitate marking locations of screw holes onto the skull. Print in same material (i.e. steel) at same scaling compensation as the main headplate to ensure identical spacing.

**Button-head torx screws, #0-80 thread, 1/8" long** -- Two bone screws are optionally used per headplate, e.g. [McMaster #90910A665](https://www.mcmaster.com/90910A665/). The headplates are to be tapped with #0-80 threads on the provided holes to mate with the screws. The 1/8" length is sized so that the screw tip should penetrate the skull but not the dura when fully driven.

**Torx-plus bit (size IP5) & driver** -- Socket head screws are driven using a torx+ bit, e.g. [McMaster #54305A18](https://www.mcmaster.com/54305A18/). A mini ratcheting 1/4" shank driver e.g. [McMaster #52815A22](https://www.mcmaster.com/52815A22/) is appropriate for such these bits.

**Spiral or burr drill bit, 1.35mm diameter** -- #0 (1.59mm) screws are intended for use with a 1.35mm diameter hole. For a 3.175mm shank, consider e.g. [McMaster #6415NM179](https://www.mcmaster.com/6415N179/), but first verify compatiblity with the dental drill in use. 

**Standoffs, 1/4"-20 thread, various lengths** -- A variety lengths of [standoffs](https://www.mcmaster.com/products/male-female-threaded-hex-standoffs/male-female-threaded-hex-standoffs-6/thread-size~1-4-20/material~stainless-steel-2/material~18-8-stainless-steel/), all of which can mate with the ThorLabs table and each other. These provide the clamping surface used with either end of the headplate. Extra standoffs allow use in combination to assemble a clamping surface at any desired height above the bed of the table.

**Threaded inserts, #6-32 to 1/4"-20** -- 
Use threaded inserts, e.g. [McMaster #90247A008](https://www.mcmaster.com/90247A008) in the shortest pair of standoffs and with the pair of the most commonly used length. The inserts allow mating with the cam clamps that top the standoffs in use. Installation of threaded inserts is permanent. 

**Clamping handle with threaded stud, #6-32 thread, 3/8" long**  -- These clamps, e.g. [McMaster #5720K25](https://www.mcmaster.com/5720K25/) are fastened to the top standoffs in use, with the aid of the threaded inserts. They should be threaded into the standoff so that the plate can be quickly inserted onto the exposed threaded stud, so that the plate is sandwiched between the circular plastic piece above and the standoff's surface below. Operating a clamp can be done one-handed in approximately a single second. When engaged, clamps exert up to 1400 N of clamping force.

## Assembly
![Partial assembly, showing interactions of pieces in use](https://i.imgur.com/H8aa3JQ.png)
Partial assembly, showing relationships of pieces in use: two stacked standoffs, cam clamp, bone screw, and headplate. Yellow crosshairs indicate probe locations for PFC, IC, and AC. Note the position of the headplate relative to the corornal suture. The headplate fits standoffs positioned exactly 2" apart; the hole spacing on the ThorLabs air table is 1", so there will be one empty hole between the two locations where standoffs are inserted.

![Half-section view, showing fit of screw with skull](https://i.imgur.com/Kcz6h7f.png) Half-section view, showing fit of 1/8" length screw with skull's interior surface. Skull is modeled from a CT scan. One half of one thread (0.5/80", ~0.16mm) of the screw protrudes into the cranial cavity when the screw is fully threaded, while the other half of the screw is fully embedded in cranium. This is deliberate, to ensure that the surgeon can always get at least one complete thread into the full thickness of skull available. (Note that even with 80 tpi, there are only 10 complete threads on a screw of this length). If a more conservative approach is needed, fit the screw to the implant before applying metabond and before affixing to skull. Drive the screw to the desired depth of protrusion from the bottom of the plate, then back the screw to recess from that surface while counting the number of revolutions travelled counterclockwise. Then, when affixing to skull, use the same number of revolutions clockwise to drive screw to predetermined depth.
