so			new=Rat_skull+mandible_high_res, the file with clear sutures (as above)
			for ALL files, the cranium was rotated -0.75 degrees about the z axis
atlas		new scaled to 107% to match to correspond closely to stereotaxic atlas 
unscaled	new's dimensions baseline
95w			new's width (transverse dimension) squished to 95% ie 9.7/10.2, the PQ distance.
min			new squashed to 83% width ie 9.3/11.1 (TU), 79% length ie 6.2/7.8 (DE), and height set to 81 for consistency of skull shape
ATLMIN		atlas squashed uniformly to 75% (80% of new) so that TU~9.3, DE~6.2		(not yet created)
ATLMED		atlas squashed uniformly to 89% (95% of new) so that PQ~9.7				(not yet created)
